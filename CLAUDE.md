## Architecture Overview

This project is an SSO (Single Sign-On) provider implementing the OpenID Connect protocol in Rust. It's structured as a Cargo workspace.

- **`sso-rs` (root crate)**: The main application logic, built with the Axum web framework.
- **`entity`**: Contains database models defined for SeaORM.
- **`migration`**: Holds the database migration files managed by `sea-orm-cli`.
- **`volo-gen`**: Contains gRPC related code generated by Volo.

The application uses `SeaORM` as the ORM for interacting with a MySQL database and `Volo` for gRPC communication.
